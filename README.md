# offline-ai-chatbots
A repository for my chatbots that can accept voice input and respond with voice input.

An eternal WIP based on [this](https://github.com/vndee/local-talking-llm) and [this](https://github.com/jakobdylanc/llmcord).

Old version is [this](https://github.com/fordinator/talking-LLM-chatbot).

Mostly here to protect me as the Original Creator.

Along with all the AI models I've known over the years...
